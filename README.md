# Flash Cards

Flash Card solo project, Mod 2 by Michael Walker

## Install/Setup instructions

* Setup - for the project setup I cloned down and forked the repo from the Turning website. [link to Turing repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flashcards-starter)

* Then I ran the `npm install` and tested that the file was working by running `npm test` if doing this from the Turning repo you should see 5 test.

* To run the flashcards open up my repo found at the bottom of the page and run `node index.js` from the root of your project.

## Project Overview

Utilizing Javascript and Test Drive Development (TDD) to make a functioning flashcard game that can be played in the terminal. The game allows the user to select an answer. Then the game will provide feedback based on if the answer was correct or incorrect. At the end of the round, the user will see the percent of questions they got correct.

## Goals

* To make a functioning flashcard game in the terminal

* To use TDD to drive the building of the game

* To get hands-on experience implementing ES6

* To write a reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principles)

## Challenges

* The Test-Driven Development by being the first major project on this front.

* Overthinking the complexity of the Round.js and Round-test.js

* Using the beforeEach for the first time to clean up some of the code which caused several errors when declaring variables.

* Implementing ES6 to develop the project for the first time.

## Overcoming Challenges

* Since the TDD was something I never have done before I made sure to do my research starting with the Turing lesson plan on TDD [Link Turing lesson on TDD](https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-2/testing-tdd-mocha-and-chai.html) I also looked at the previous test examples from project Mythical Creatures assigned in MOD-1 at Turning. Then I expounded on those ideas with my peers.

* During the Round.js and test I hit a bit of a sticking point. This was resolved by pseudo coding as well as using my peers and mentor to talk over my ideas once established.

* The test that I had written started to get rather lengthy due to repeating my test code. This was resolved during class by seeing an example of beforeEach. I implemented that example into my project to clean up the testing file.

* Implementing ES6 came in waves often referring to the MDN documentation as a reference guide or notes from a lesson.

## Thanks

I would like to thank the Turning Instructors for issuing and reviewing the project. I would also like to thank my peers 2006 Cohort for allowing me to verbalize ideas. Finally, I would like to thank my mentor Nathaniel D Foster for helping with the Round.js testing section.
